# Gradient-based Uncertainty for Monocular Depth Estimation

This repository contains the official implementation of our  ECCV 2022 paper. 

## Requirements
TODO

## Datasets
We conduct our evaluations on the datasets [NYU Depth V2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html) and [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php). 
[NYU Depth V2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html) is downloaded  as provided by [FastDepth](https://github.com/dwofk/fast-depth). [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php) is downloaded according to the instructions from [mono-uncertainty](https://github.com/mattpoggi/mono-uncertainty).

## Acknowledgement
We used and modified code parts from the open source projects [monodepth2](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2) and [mono-uncertainty](https://github.com/mattpoggi/mono-uncertainty). We like to thank the authors for making their code publicly available.
